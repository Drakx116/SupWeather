# SupWeather

### Project overview 
SupWeather is a small weather web application where you can easily see the current weather of your favorite towns.

This is easy ! Just create an account and add your cities with personal markers on your own map.

### Installation

SupWeather requires a recent version of [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) to run.

Unzip the project archive or clone it via Github (private repository for the moment) :
```sh
$ git clone https://github.com/Drakx116/SupWeather.git
```

Then, you will need to install the dependencies, in the /server and /app package.json files.

Server :
```sh
$ cd server
$ npm i
```

Client :
```sh
$ cd app
$ npm i
```

### Launching

Once the dependencies are installed, simply launch the server and the client by running the two following command lines :

Server :
```sh
$ cd server
$ npm start
```

Client :
```sh
$ cd app
$ npm start
```

Basically, the server runs on port 3000. By running the client, you will get the following line :

```sh
$ Would you like to run the app on another port instead? (Y/n) 
```

Simply press "Y", and check your browser.


### Deployment

A online version may be released in the next update.
